# Layan cursors for Windows
This is a windows cursor theme based on [Layan-Cursors](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Layan-cursors).
I used [win2xcur](https://pypi.org/project/win2xcur/) to convert the cursos to the cur/ani format.

## Installation
To install the cursor theme simply right click the Install.inf file and click the install option.

## Usage

If you're using Windows 10/11 you have to set up the cursor theme by going into the Control Panel/Mouse/Pointers and change the scheme to Layan Cursors.
